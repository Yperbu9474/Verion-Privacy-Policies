<h1>Privacy Policy for LockQR</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> January 2025</p>

<p>LockQR (“the App”) is developed by Verion Tech. This Privacy Policy explains how the App handles user information. LockQR is committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about how information is used.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>LockQR does <strong>not collect, store, or transmit any personal information</strong>. The App does not gather names, email addresses, contact information, location data, analytics, or device identifiers.</p>

<h2>2. Local Device Storage</h2>
<p>The App uses your device’s <strong>local storage</strong> for two purposes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Saving QR codes generated by the user</li>
    <li>Allowing the user to upload an image from their device and scan a QR code within it</li>
</ul>
<p>All QR code data is processed entirely <strong>on your device</strong>. Nothing is uploaded, transmitted, or shared with Verion Tech or any third party.</p>

<h2>3. Advertising</h2>
<p>LockQR displays advertisements using third-party advertising networks such as Google AdMob.</p>
<p>These third-party networks may collect device identifiers to deliver relevant ads. This information is handled independently by the ad network and is not accessed or stored by LockQR.</p>
<p>Google Ad Privacy Policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads</a></p>

<h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>LockQR is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.</p>

<h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
<p>LockQR does not share, sell, or transmit data to any third parties. No data is sent to external servers. All processing remains on the user’s device.</p>

<h2>6. Security</h2>
<p>Because the App does not collect or store personal information, no personal data is saved outside the device. QR data remains private on your device at all times.</p>

<h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any updates will be posted on this webpage.</p>
